**Simplify Your React Application Setup**

Developing a modern React application often requires setting up several dependencies and configurations right from the start. This initial setup can be time-consuming and repetitive, involving numerous commands to install various libraries such as routers, CSS frameworks, UI component libraries, state management libraries, and fetching libraries. Additionally, configuring these to work together seamlessly can be a source of many initial headaches for developers.

## Problem

Setting up a new React project involves:
- Installing multiple npm packages individually.
- Configuring routers like React Router for navigation.
- Setting up state management solutions like Redux, mobX or Zustand.
- Integrating UI component libraries such as Material UI, Chakra UI or Ant Design.
- Configuring CSS preprocessors or frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.
- Adding fetching libraries to handle API communications effectively.

This process is not only tedious but also prone to errors, especially in compatibility and versioning.

## Solution

`@ishaaan/headstarter` is a powerful CLI tool designed to streamline and simplify the process of setting up a new React project. By installing this tool globally, developers can kickstart a new project with all necessary dependencies and configurations in one go.

### Features
- **One-Command Setup**: Run a single command to set up your React project.
- **Customizable Options**: Choose from popular libraries and frameworks during setup.
- **Time-Saving**: Significantly reduce the time to set up a new project.
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistency across different projects with standardized setup procedures.

## Installation

Install `@ishaaan/headstarter` globally using npm:


```npm install -g @ishaaan/headstarter```
Usage

Once installed, you can start a new project by simply running:


```headstarter```


Follow the interactive prompts to select the frameworks and libraries you wish to include in your project. @ishaaan/headstarter handles all installations and configurations for you, setting up a project directory with everything you need to dive right into development.




## Roadmap

### Short-Term Updates

- **Next.js Support**: We plan to add support for Next.js, allowing users to easily set up a Next.js project with optimal configurations.


These updates aim to enhance the flexibility of the tool, making it suitable for more diverse development needs and simplifying more complex setups.

### Long-Term Updates

- **Full Stack Capabilities**: In the long term, we aim to include backend technologies to allow developers to set up full-stack applications seamlessly. This update will enable the tool to scaffold both frontend and backend simultaneously, supporting a variety of backend frameworks and databases.
- **Expanded Library Support**: Continuously add support for more libraries and frameworks based on community feedback and trends in development practices.

These long-term goals are aimed at turning `@ishaaan/headstarter` into a comprehensive solution for initiating full-stack projects, reducing the initial development overhead, and helping developers focus more on creating unique functionalities rather than setting up environments.
